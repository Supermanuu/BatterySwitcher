# Sofle Battery Switcher

[![CI](https://github.com/Supermanuu/BatterySwitcher/actions/workflows/gerber.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/Supermanuu/BatterySwitcher/actions/workflows/gerber.yml)

We are triying yo make a battery switch for the Sofle Keyboard, or properly said, the Pro Micro board used by the Sofle Keyboard. 

Our goal is to have a PCB that could short and open the baterry supply via a switch, keeping as low profile as possible and doing it as integrated as possible
