This build needs a battery connector only if you have soldered the J1 connector only.

The materials that you  will need apart of  the BOM are described [here](../out-of-bom.md).

To mount the battery connector you should cut the wires at the appropiate length and crimp a cable terminator.

Then you should insert the terminators into the connector housing. Finally you have your battery connector ready!

To finish the mounting follow [final step](bending.md).
