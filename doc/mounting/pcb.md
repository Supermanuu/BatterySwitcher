# Mounting the PCB

1. Solder the D1 component. Place the PCB on the bottom view and solder the diode paths with caution.
2. Solder the J1 component (optional). From the bottom view, solder the connector. Use tape for secure and effective placement.
3. Solder the S1 component. Just solder the three pins using tape.
4. Solder the J2 and J3 components. Place the PCB from the top view and use more tape.

At the end you have your PCB ready!

Follow the [battery connector](battery-connector.md) section if you have soldered the battery connector and you havent done yet.

To finish the mounting follow [final step](bending.md).
